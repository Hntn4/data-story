          <h2>Regional Consistency</h2>
          <p class="lead">Are SafeConnect support services provided with the same frequency across Connecticut?</p>

          <p>The Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence <a href="http://www.ctcadv.org/">(CCADV)</a> is the state's central domestic violence hotline providing 7 different services over the phone to over 25,000 CT residents in need a year, those seven consisting of counseling, victim advocacy, information providing, civil legal support, referrals, criminal justice support, and safety planning. After looking over the CCADV data from the past 2 years, we wanted to see where the agency’s services were being provided most, in order to see if there are any inconsistencies between regions. More specifically, we wanted to know if any of the 7 services might be recommended disproportionately in certain areas. </p>

          <p>Our most significant findings bode well for the CCADV, as there is a remarkable consistency in provided services across each state region. While new Haven and Middletown are at the lower end of the spectrum and Stamford is at the higher end, the spread between them is incredibly tight. In short, we found no significant issues in the frequency of how these services were provided. </p>

        <p>While we had access to a lot of raw data, normalizing it in such a way that made it meaningful was a good bit of work. You can view the work we did on our google sheet, which will be linked at the end of the section. Essentially, we began with the masked CCADV data and the Connecticut census data and went from there, making pivot tables, normalized data tables, and contextualizing the data in any possible way we thought would be useful. Even the slightest chance of using the data later meant it got attention. The most in-depth we went was with some of the CCADV data, in which we tracked the action taken post-call by the CCADV, and organized it by race, region, and proportionally to residents in both of those categories.</p>

          <p>While we are fairly confident in our data analysis, there are some uncertainties in our final work. We did not include data on victims from outside of Connecticut, as it did not fit well into charts or maps that were specifically state-based. We also had some miscalculations in our earlier drafts of this report, and while we fixed each of those, mistakes have been made before. As always, it is  important to note that while we believe there’s a correlation here, there are a number of other factors influencing all of this information, and so the causal relationship we are looking for may not exist in the way we think it does.</p>
