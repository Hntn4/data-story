          <h2>Story</h2>
          <p class="lead">(add title question for intro here)</p>

          <p>The Connecticut Coalition Against Domestic Violence <a href="http://www.ctcadv.org/">(CCADV)</a> is the state's central domestic violence hotline providing 7 different services over the phone to over 25,000 CT residents in need a year, those seven consisting of counseling, victim advocacy, information providing, civil legal support, referrals, criminal justice support, and safety planning. After looking over the CCADV data from the past 2 years, we wanted to see where the agency’s services were being provided most, both by location and by racial demographic, in order to see if there are any inconsistencies between groups. More specifically, we wanted to know if any of the 7 services might be recommended disproportionately in certain regions or to certain groups.  
Upon careful analysis, we recognized that New Haven is a significant outlier in Connecticut regions in terms of how much less likely the region is to recommend all services to callers. We hope CCADV is able to use this data to improve the quality of assistance they are able to offer to clients.</p>

          <p>Most strikingly, we found that the New Haven Region provided each service in a at a lower rate than any other region.  While keeping in mind they receive more total calls than any other region relative to their population (see map 1), the nearby Bridgeport region has a similar number of proportional calls and yet is above the CT average for services recommended across all the demographics. 
Conversely, we found that the Stamford region provided services more often than any other region across demographics(See Chart 2). In fact, the difference in the percent of callers receiving the various services between Stamford and New Haven Regions is more than any other two regions across every service except Civil/Legal. 
The greatest overall variance between regions in a single service was that between the New Haven and Meriden regions in the Civil/Legal service shown in Map 2. Tables 1, 2, and 3, all provided additional representation of the data shown in the maps and charts above. 
</a>

          <p>While we had access to a lot of raw data, normalizing it in such a way that made it meaningful was a good bit of work. You can view the work we did on our google sheet, which will be linked at the end of the section. Essentially, we began with the masked CCADV data and the Connecticut census data and went from there, making pivot tables, normalized data tables, and contextualizing the data in any possible way we thought would be useful. Even the slightest chance of using the data later meant it got attention. The most in-depth we went was with some of the CCADV data, in which we tracked the action taken post-call by the CCADV, and organized it by race, region, and proportionally to residents in both of those categories.</p>

          <p>One of the most significant uncertainties in our work would be the data based on the callers that did not identify their race. It should be noted that some of the specifics for race/ethnicity were masked as to prevent identification of a victim: callers of unidentified race and callers from race/ethnicity groups with less than 5 records per age group per region were all placed into the “other-unknown” category (age group was a separate subcategory used to organize the masked caller data that we did not touch on in this report). As necessary as this is from a safety standpoint, it restricts the trust we can put into our findings, as they are missing fundamental information from just over 30% of first-time callers. We also did not include a lot of the data on victims outside of Connecticut, as it did not fit well into charts or maps that were state-based. It is also important to note that while we believe there’s a correlation here, there are a number of other factors influencing all of this information, and so the causal relationship we are looking for may not exist in the way we think it does.</p>
